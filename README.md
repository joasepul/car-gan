This is a course project for CMPS240 at UC Santa Cruz.

This an optimized Generative Adversarial Network that maps edges to photos.
This has been researched and implemented in the pix2pix paper, but it has never
been explored using Google's BigGAN.

We will be using [Stanford's car dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/stanford-cars-dataset).


For more information see our [project proposal](project-proposal.pdf).
