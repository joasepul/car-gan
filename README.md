This is a course project for CMPS240 at UC Santa Cruz.

This an optimized Generative Adversarial Network that maps edges to photos.
This has been researched and implemented in the [pix2pix paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.07004.pdf), but it has never
been explored using [Google's BigGAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.11096.pdf).

We will be using [Stanford's car dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/stanford-cars-dataset).


For more information see our [project proposal](project-proposal.pdf).
